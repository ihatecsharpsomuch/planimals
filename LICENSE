                    GAY ANALYSING (GA) GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 1.1, 11 July 2024

 Copyright (C) 2024 Gay Analysing, Inc. <https://gayanalysing.co.uk/>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

  The GA General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
software and other kinds of works.

  I don't really know if you, a billion-dollar company, actually decided to steal 
this code. Perhaps you are in deep shit (very deep shit) if you stopped here for 
new projects or something. This crappy code was written for a pack of chips with 
cheese and a can of Sprite, not for $10k a month like your overpaid developers.

TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION, AND MODIFICATION

0. Definitions.

  “This License” refers to version 1.1 of the GA General Public License.

  “The Program” refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License.

  “You” refers to the licensee.

1. You may copy, distribute, and modify the Program provided that you meet the
   following conditions:

    a. You may not use the Program for commercial purposes if your company 
       has a capitalization of more than 1 billion dollars. In other words, 
       if you're a goddamn billion-dollar corporation, hands off.

    b. You must not copy the code and sell it. Trying to profit off this 
       without permission is not just illegal; it makes you an asshole.

    c. You may not claim the code as your own unless it is a fork of the 
       original code. Don’t be a dick; give credit where credit is due.

2. If you distribute copies or modified versions of the Program, you must 
   retain all copyright notices and disclaimers.

3. You must provide clear attribution to the original author, Gay Analysing, Inc., 
   in any distribution or modification of the Program. Seriously, don’t be a douche; 
   show some respect.

4. You may not impose any additional restrictions on the rights granted by this 
   License.

5. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, 
   service marks, or names of the Licensor.

6. The Program is provided “as is,” without warranty of any kind, express or 
   implied, including but not limited to the warranties of merchantability, 
   fitness for a particular purpose, and noninfringement. If it breaks, that’s 
   your problem.

7. In no event shall the authors or copyright holders be liable for any claim, 
   damages, or other liability, whether in an action of contract, tort, or 
   otherwise, arising from, out of, or in connection with the Program or the 
   use or other dealings in the Program. If you fuck up, it’s on you.
